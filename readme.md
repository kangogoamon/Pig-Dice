## Website Name: Pig Dice
I created this website to allow two players to play a game of dice where one rolls twice then hits 'hold' to change turns, and the first player to get his/her total tally to 100 wins! If a value of 1 is rolled by the die generator, then the respective player's turn is immediately over and their round total is 0.
## Description
The game can be played by two players where each get two rolls of the dice before hitting 'Hold' button to let the other player take their turn.
